This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to implicit type conversion within conditional statements. The `f` function aims to classify numbers based on their sign. However, unexpected behavior arises because VBScript automatically converts data types in comparisons, leading to incorrect results in certain cases. The solution involves explicit type checking to ensure the comparison works as intended.
